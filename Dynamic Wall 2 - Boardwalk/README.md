# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Dynamic Walls 2 - Boardwalk

- Project category: _Dynamic Wall behavior_
- Team members: _Yu Xuan Wu_

## The Math

The wave equation, derived by applying fixed values for a sine or cosine wave's amplitude, period (time), and distance covered, can be used to simulate a basic ocean wave like motion.

## The Submission

Waves are special among transformations of trigonometric functions because they specify some initial conditions about different aspects of a trigonometric curve. Different values on the wave's amplitude, distance, and period, allows for the specific modelling of waves appearing in nature. This piece displays a constant water wave, accentuated by elevated 'wooden planks'.
