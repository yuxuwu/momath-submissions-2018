# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Math Square - Balls

- Project category: _Math Square behavior_
- Team members: _Yu Xuan Wu_

## The Math

Equations for calculating force when affected by an object's weight & gravity and linear algebra equations to direct the velocity of balls were used to control the behavior of the balls, while trigonometry was used extensively to handle object collision by measure the distance between shapes.

## The Submission

This game highlights the physics of weight, and its impact on another force's magnitude. Balls with differing weights are shot out of a cannon, and the use of 'bungees' created with a player's feet directs the balls to a target. Heavier objects are substantially more difficult to direct, since the spring force is negatively impacted by the object's weight, while lighter obejcts are prone to be overshot. Players have to play against the weight of the balls to score points. The game is difficult enough to be challenging enough for players of any age, but the simplistic nature of the game allows younger players to focus on manipulating game objects.
