# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Dynamic Wall 1 - Frequency

- Project category: _Dynamic Wall behavior_
- Team members: _Yu Xuan Wu_

## The Math

This piece is based on the cyclical nature trigonometric functions, sine and cosine, each slab placed in progressively increasing frequencies and lower oscillating periods. One half of the wall is reflected over the middle.

## The Submission

Reglar trigonometric functions will oscillate between a range of -1 and 1. This repeating property allows for the generation of repetitive patterns, and this submissions hope to highlight the variability of the sine and cosine functions, while also demonstrating their orderly and periodic nature. More and more waves flow chaotically from the mid-point, until a period where each wave converges back to its starting point.
